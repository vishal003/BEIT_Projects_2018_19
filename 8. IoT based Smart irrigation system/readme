3. Description:

The irrigation system on automation uses optimal resources to improve the efficiency of the irrigation.
This system can be implemented in places that face water shortage to improve agricultural
sustainability. In this project a prototype includes sensing element node and data storage on cloud. The
sensing element node is deployed on the field for sensing the soil parameters such as temperature,
moisture, luminosity and humidity. According to the soil parameters the automation is achieved by
turning the motor on/off based on the set threshold value embedded in the code. All the data is stored
on cloud, which represent the data in graphical chart, from that it can be checked how much water was
consumed by plant and how many times the pump was turned on. Additionally, same data can be seen
on the website.
