Problem Statement :
The Quality Detection of Fruits is totally a manual and cumbersome process.The problem that arises is
that there is no single fruit which can be said it is pure from outside just by looks. This causes the 
humans to buy from various unreliable sources and understanding of the fruit is unclear at the end. 
This leads to health problem in human.Also, for sellers and common peoples proper platform is not available
currently to check the fruits.Manual method of fruits quality detection is also a costly process.Hence,there 
is a need to upgrade the manual system with automated system which can detects the quality of fruits using 
colour spectrography.


               
Project Implimentation Description:
In this project we have developed a cost-efficient fruit quality detection system using RGB values of 
fruits which minimizes the human efforts. The Proposed Systems main objective was to determine the quality 
of fruits at entry level of grading where humans are present to do the task as every human being as different
way of perspective so our system will have a standard range to reduce the error.we have used color sensor and
on the predefined color range, we can find the good and bad quality of a fruit. If the range sensed by the sensor
is within the predefined range a green light will blink which specifies the fruit sample passed the test and its
quality is good whereas if the red light blinks the fruit sample failed the test and its quality is not good.
