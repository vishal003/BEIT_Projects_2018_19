Project Impolementation Description:

In this digital-era, security and automation is one of the utmost requirement for home. This project aims to develop a system to assist specially abled people by providing them with various automation facilities in their home and secure their lifestyle by identifying faces and grant them access using a face detection system at cheaper rates.
Though various techniques have been proposed and are available currently, most of them are not user friendly for the specially abled people and thus a friendly system has been developed for them.To demonstrate the feasibility and eﬀectiveness of this system, devices such as light switches, power plug, gas sensor and motion sensors have been integrated with the proposed home control system. These devices can be controlled through a web application or via android based smart phone application.
Unlike most of available home automation system in the market the proposed system is scalable so that one server can manage many hardware interface modules as long as it exists on WiFi network coverage. System supports a wide range of home automation devices and security components.
In recent years considerable progress has been made in the area of face recognition. Through the work of computer science engineers, computers can now outperform humans in many face recognition tasks, particularly those in which large databases of faces must be searched. Face recognition system is widely used for human identiﬁcation due to its capability to measure and subsequently identiﬁes human identiﬁcation especially for security purposes. This system presents the development of Graphical User Interface (GUI) based on face recognition system and NodeMCU microcontroller as an input/output carrier to switch on/oﬀ tower bolt lock for door lock security system. The development is implemented by interfacing GUI built in python with microcontroller to auto-switching tower bolt for door lock security system. Thingspeak server is used to interface between GUI and NodeMCU microcontroller that allows input data transmission from GUI to microcontroller. The developed system shows that the auto-switching mode transmission being implemented via NodeMCU microcontroller. It was also found that GUI can successfully switch on and oﬀ the tower bolt lock when an authorized image from GUI database is identiﬁed. The proposed system is better from the scalability, cost eﬃciency and ﬂexibility point of view than the commercially available home automation systems.

Problem:

Security has been a serious issue faced by people over the last years. Not only Security but the unavailability of resources to control everything in the house remotely is also a problem. Automating and Securing homes using cost eﬃcient equipments and technologies is very complicated. With so many Minds developing systems to cover all these constraints none of them are aﬀordable to a specially abled. A System is needed to eﬃciently Automate and Secure the dwelling of such mass at aﬀordable rates.

The objective of this project is to build a smart home system for specially abled people which can be used to control the home appliances via internet.As technology is advancing so houses are also getting smarter.The home automation device that you build can be integrated with almost all the home appliances.
To facilitate the wireless connectivity with the system, the microcontroller will be embedded with a WiFi module. This establishes the internet connection to the system and all the home appliances can in turn be connected and controlled by internet.It helps to automate the switches to centralized system unlike traditional conventional switches
Android controlled smart home automation should be able to control the home appliances using wireless network with eﬀectively and eﬃciently. The Proposed Systems main objective helps Specially Abled people by helping them to control and secure their home appliances and also making them aware of their environments by alerting them in case of emergencies. Additional features which help specially abled people with notiﬁcation system of door bell with alert lights and security provided by face recognition system. Key Points of the project are as follows: 
• To make Cost-Ecient System for Specially abled. 
• To Provide Security
• To Make Smart Home.
• Minimize The Human Eort.
