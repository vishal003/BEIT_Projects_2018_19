Communication is the basic form for exchanging thoughts, views, perception and the ideas we think. 
The person suffering from hearing and speaking disabilities knows sign language and whenever they want to communicate with us they do it via gestures i.e. sign language and most of the times we are unaware as to what it means.
Hence to bridge the gap, we are creating a sign language translator which would not only translate gesture performed by these person and it will convert it into text & audio and also it will convert text/audio from us to sign language.
