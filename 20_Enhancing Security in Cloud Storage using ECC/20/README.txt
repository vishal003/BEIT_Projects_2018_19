Breaf Description:- 


Elliptic Curve Cryptography provides greater security and more e?cient performance than the ?rst 
generation public key techniques like RSA now in use. As vendors look to upgrade their systems
 they should seriously consider the elliptic curve alternative for the computational and bandwidth
 advantages they o?er at comparable security. Although ECCs security has not been completely evaluated, 
it is expected to come into widespread use in various ?elds in the future. After comparing the RSA and ECC ciphers, 
the ECC has proved to involve much less overheads compared to RSA. The ECC has many advantages due to
 its ability to provide the same level of security as RSA yet using shorter keys. However, its disadvantage 
which may even hide its attractiveness is its lack of maturity, as mathematicians believed that enough research 
has not yet been done in ECC.
