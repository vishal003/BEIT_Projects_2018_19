3.The usage of Biometric fingerprint system for student attendance monitoring as developed and deployed in order to
  decrease time wasted during manual collection of attendance and an opportunity for the faculty to generate student statistics
  for allocation of appropriate attendance scores and for further decisions.This proposed solution for the current problem is 
  through automation of attendance system using fingerprint recognition.The main idea of this project is to implement fingerprint 
  based web application for attendance management and retrieval system for advancement of institution and educational system. 
  Arduino is used for computation in the fingerprint detection and recognition modules.This system helps teacher to take attendance 
  through fingerprint of the students and keep record of students.The system will automatically update the student’s presence in the 
  class to the student’s database using Wifi Module on web application.
