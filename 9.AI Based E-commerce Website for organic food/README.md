iii.Brief Description about Project Implementation
		The term organic refers to the way agricultural products are grown and processed. Organic
	produce and other organic ingredients in retail products are grown without the use of synthetic
	pesticides and fertilizers, sewage sludge, genetically modified organisms or ionizing radiation.
	Proposed System provide online product which are growth in natural way so, anyone can
	buy it online and eat healthy food which help them to stay fit. There are log in for customer
	and vendor. By log in customer can choose product, add to cart and purchase. Farmers and
	vendor can add their product by their log in. Also it provides great profit to farmers.
	Many people get sick because of eating food which is growth using artificial fertilizers. These
	chemicals are very harmful for the human beings health especially for the children. Our motive
	is to provide food that are carefully grown by our Indian Farmers from 100\% organic manure
	and compost, without use of any artificial pesticides and fertilizers. We have started this system
	to ensure the best saying  "Prevention is better than Cure".\\This system gives the farmer the facility to add their products them selves on the website but before displaying it on the home page it will be verified by the admin and if it is a true product it will be approved.The farmer should upload their QR code of Paytm at the time of registration for the payment process.This system is a option for the customer where they can get organic food but we dont give 100\% assurance for the organic food displayed on the home page.
